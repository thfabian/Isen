Isen - Two dimensional isentropic model
==================

*Isen* is a two dimensional isentropic vertical coordinate model derived from the existing Matlab implementation of the course *Numerical Modelling of Weather and Climate* (701-1216-00L) at ETH ZÃ¼rich. The newly developed model, written in C++11, achieves a speedup factor of 49x with repsect to the Matlab code while retaining the ease of use due to a powerful Python frontend. The code is carefully optimized for modern shared-memory multiprocessors.
